  - question: how do you define a single node openshift?
    answer: |
      About OpenShift on a single node (SNO)

      You can create a single-node cluster with standard installation methods.
      OpenShift Container Platform on a single node is a specialized
      installation that requires the creation of a special ignition
      configuration ISO. The primary use case is for edge computing
      workloads, including intermittent connectivity, portable clouds, and
      5G radio access networks (RAN) close to a base station.
      The major tradeoff with an installation on a single node is the
      lack of high availability.

  - question: What is an SNO?
    answer: |
      A SNO is a single-node Openshift,
      or Single Node Openshift.
      A cluster composed by only one node.
      Specially designed for working at Edge,
      but it can also run on suppored clouds.
  - question: Can you add workers to an SNO?
    answer: |
      Yes, a SNO allows to add an extra worker.
  - question: What are the requirements for an SNO?
    answer: |
      | **Prile**      | **vCPU**     | **Memory**  | **Storage** |
      |----------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
      | Minimum        | 8 vCPU cores | 16 GB RAM   | 120 GB      |
  - question: Which is the preferable method to deploy an SNO?
    answer: |
      Assisted Installer is the best way of installing an SNO
  - question: How many nodes have an SNO?
    answer: |
      An SNO, that stands for Single Node Openshift,
      it is compossed by only one node.
      But there is one special configurarion that allows
      to add one worker.
